      "The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969 at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was first released in 1971 and was initially entirely written in assembly language, a common practice at the time. Later, in a key pioneering approach in 1973, Unix was re-written in the programming language C by Dennis Ritchie (with exceptions to the kernel and I/O). The availability of an operating system written in a high-level language allowed easier portability to different computer platforms. \n",

      "With a legal glitch forcing AT&T to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked, Unix quickly grew and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. The success of the UNIX operating system has led to many different versions.  The recipients of the then free UNIX system code all began developing their own different versions in their own, different, ways for use and sale. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1983 Richard Stallman, started the GNU Project with the goal of creating a \"complete Unix-compatible software system\" composed entirely of free software. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs. Free of the legal glitch requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1985, Richard Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a move intended to unify the market in 1987, AT&T announced a pact with Sun Microsystems, the rest of the industry viewed the development with considerable concern believing that their own markets were under threat they clubbed together to develop their own \"new\" open systems operating system. The ensuing \"UNIX wars\" divided the system vendors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel were stalled and incomplete.\n",
